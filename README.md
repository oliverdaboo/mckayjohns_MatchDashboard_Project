# Generating a Match Dashboard

This project uses **StatsBomb** open data to generate automated, professional-quality football match dashboards. Using Python, it processes event data to create a single-page visual summary of a match, including passing networks, shot maps, and xG flow charts.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard generated by this tool includes:
* **Passing Networks:** Shows player positions and passing volume for both teams.
* **Shot Maps:** Visualizes every shot taken, scaled by its Expected Goals (xG) value.
* **xG Flow Chart:** Displays the cumulative xG throughout the 90 minutes (and extra time).
* **Match Stats:** A detailed summary table of key performance metrics.

## Installation

To run the notebook and generate your own dashboards, you will need to install the following libraries:

math, pandas, matplotlib, statsbombpy, mplsoccer, Pillow, numpy

## To Run the Main Function

The create_match_dashboard function takes in the following paramters:

* match_id (int): A valid match ID from the StatsBomb open-source data.

* team1_color (string): A color hex code for the home team (e.g., '#264653').

* team2_color (string): A color hex code for the away team (e.g., '#e9c46a').

* match_info (Pandas Series or dict, optional): A row of metadata containing the match details. Providing this acts as a performance shortcut. Instead of the function searching the entire StatsBomb database to find which competition and season the match belongs to, it uses this object to immediately extract the team names, match date, and competition stage.

* show_team_badges (bool, optional): A toggle to determine whether team logos are displayed in the header. Defaults to True. If set to False, the function will skip the logo rendering entirely, which is useful if you do not have the image files locally.

team1_image (string, optional): The local file path to the home team's logo image (e.g., '/Users/name/Desktop/logos/team1.png'). This is required if show_team_badges is True.

team2_image (string, optional): The local file path to the away team's logo image. This is required if show_team_badges is True.


Expected match_info structure: If you provide this parameter, the object must contain the following keys:

* home_team: Name of the home team.

* away_team: Name of the away team.

* match_date: Date of the match (YYYY-MM-DD).

* competition: Name of the tournament.

* competition_stage: The current round (e.g., Group Stage, Final).

## Issues

1. The world cup dashboards don't contain team badges or the correct team hex colors. It would have taken too long to compile all of that, so I left the badges off and made the team colors neutral
2. In the France vs. Australia match, a player number on the pass network for France is a ? instead of a real number. This is because they made in early substitution in the game, and it become hard to retrieve the jersey number of the player who entered the game. This is something I could not find a solution to, but leaving it as ? seemed the best thing to do for now.
